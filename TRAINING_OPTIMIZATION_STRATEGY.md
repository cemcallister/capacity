# üéì Training Optimization Strategy
## From Expert-Dependent to Distributed Competency Model

**Document**: Strategic Analysis and Implementation Guide  
**Focus**: Option 6 Training Optimization Approach  
**Audience**: Operations Leadership and Training Managers

---

## üéØ Strategic Philosophy

### Current State: Expert-Dependent Operations
**Characteristics**:
- Small group of highly qualified engineers handle complex tasks
- Junior engineers relegated to basic maintenance
- Knowledge concentrated in few individuals
- High overtime costs for expert engineers
- Operational vulnerability during expert absences

**Example**: Rob Parker (72 qualifications) vs. John Booth (3 qualifications)

### Target State: Distributed Competency Model
**Characteristics**:
- Balanced qualification distribution across all engineers
- Multiple engineers qualified for each critical system
- Clear progression pathways for skill development
- Reduced dependency on individual experts
- Operational resilience and flexibility

## üìä Priority-Based Training Algorithm

### Scoring Methodology
```
Priority Score = (Daily Impact √ó 10) + (Weekly Impact √ó 5) + (Monthly Impact √ó 2)
```

**Rationale**:
- **Daily qualifications** have highest impact (operational criticality)
- **Weekly qualifications** provide medium-term stability
- **Monthly qualifications** ensure long-term coverage

### Current Priority Rankings

#### Team 1 Top Priorities
1. **John Booth**: 20 quals needed, Score: 104 (5 daily impact)
2. **Leon Bedford**: 21 quals needed, Score: 103 (5 daily impact)  
3. **Thomas Thornton**: 21 quals needed, Score: 103 (5 daily impact)

#### Team 2 Top Priorities
1. **Ted Edwards**: 27 quals needed, Score: 142 (8 daily impact)
2. **Charlie Wood**: 27 quals needed, Score: 140 (7 daily impact)
3. **Tom Billing**: 28 quals needed, Score: 139 (7 daily impact)

### Phase 3: Optimization and Refinement (Months 13-18)
**Focus**: System-wide optimization and continuous improvement

**Activities**:
- Advanced specializations based on aptitude and interest
- Expert role transition to mentoring and complex problem-solving
- Process refinement based on performance data

**Long-term Outcomes**:
- **Resilient operations** with redundant expertise
- **Career progression satisfaction** across all levels
- **Sustainable growth model** for future expansion
- **Competitive operational advantage** through workforce excellence

## üé¢ Ride Assignment Strategy

### MILP-Driven Allocation
The system uses mathematical optimization to assign rides based on:

**Constraints**:
- **Workload balance**: Team 1 (5 rides avg), Team 2 (6 rides avg)
- **Type distribution**: Equal A/B/C ride allocation per engineer
- **Role compatibility**: Electrical vs. mechanical qualifications
- **Coverage requirements**: 100% across all PPM schedules

**Example Assignment**:
John Booth ‚Üí NUMT, OBLV, PRHH, SUBT, THRT (2A + 1B + 2C)

### Training Focus per Assignment
Each engineer receives **complete qualification sets** for their assigned rides:
- **Daily PPMs**: Critical operational qualifications (highest priority)
- **Weekly PPMs**: Preventive maintenance competencies  
- **Monthly PPMs**: Comprehensive system knowledge

## üìà Business Case Analysis
