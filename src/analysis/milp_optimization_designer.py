"""
Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) Optimization Designer
============================================================

This module uses PuLP to solve the qualification assignment problem as a
mathematical optimization problem, guaranteeing both complete coverage
and fairness through linear programming.

Key Features:
- Guarantees 100% coverage for all PPMs in required time windows
- Minimizes qualification variance (fairness objective)
- Handles complex shift patterns and constraints
- Uses proven mathematical optimization algorithms
- Scalable and extensible
