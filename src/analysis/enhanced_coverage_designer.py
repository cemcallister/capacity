Enhanced Coverage-Optimized Designer - MAXIMUM COVERAGE + BALANCED ASSIGNMENTS
================================================================================

This is the next generation coverage optimizer that addresses the limitations of
the original coverage_optimized_designer.py:

IMPROVEMENTS:
- MAXIMUM COVERAGE: 6-8 engineers per daily PPM (not 3-4)
- BALANCED ASSIGNMENTS: Even distribution of workload and qualifications  
- MULTI-PASS OPTIMIZATION: Iterative improvement until 90%+ coverage achieved
- COMPREHENSIVE REDUNDANCY: Every critical daily PPM has abundant coverage
- LOAD BALANCING: No engineer overloaded while others underutilized
